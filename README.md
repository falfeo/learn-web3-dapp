# Figment learing path

Code following course "Learn the Web 3 basics with our 101 Pathways".

From the original description of course:

"We made this decentralized application (dApp) to help developers learn about Web 3 protocols. It uses TypeScript, React, and various smart contract languages.

Following along with the [Figment Learn Pathways](https://learn.figment.io/pathways/), you will build up a simple web client using various JavaScript APIs to interact with different blockchain networks. Each protocol is slightly different, but we have attempted to standardize the workflow so that you can quickly get up to speed on networks like Solana, NEAR, Secret and Polygon!
